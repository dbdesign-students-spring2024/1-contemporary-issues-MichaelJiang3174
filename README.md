# The Impact, Cybersecurity Issues, and Business Implications of Microsoft's January 2024 Email Breach
In this document, I discuss two article about the cyber hacking attack Microsoft received in January of this year. I present and discuss two different views on this important matter.

## Article 1
In Dataconomy's [Microsoft security breach: What you need to know](https://dataconomy.com/2024/01/22/microsoft-security-breach/),the article reports on a major security breach perpetrated by Midnight Blizzard (APT29 or Cozy Bear) at Microsoft, and is suspected to be supported by the Russian state. They used the method of a password spray attack on a legacy account, targeting the e-mail accounts of top Microsoft executives. They are not looking for customer data or corporate information, but instead are targeting internal security strategies and executive accounts. The article also focuses on the broader implications of such security breaches, arguing that such state-sponsored hacker groups are increasingly invading the information and cybersecurity of individual countries.

In my perspective, in this era of information development, the issue of network security is getting more and more attention and concern. Prior to this incident, there had been a number of more significant hacking incidents, and now even the most technologically advanced companies are affected. Gaining strategic insight into a national network station can be just as valuable as conventional data hacking. I think this breach is a wake-up call for companies to pay more attention to the security needs and modernization of their systems. It also represents an upward trend in state-sponsored cyberattacks, highlighting the fact that cybersecurity is not just a corporate issue, but also a national and international security issue.

## Article 2
Different with the pointview presented in Dataconomy's piece on this issue, The Register's [What Microsoft's latest email breach says about this IT security heavyweight](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/24/microsoft_latest_breach_cozy_bear/) discusses the potential impression of the event from a different perspective. The article also notes that Microsoft has been criticized for not implementing multi-factor authentication in this case, which would have prevented the attack. Differently, however, the article emphasizes Microsoft still succeed in winning government and corporate contracts despite the breach. Although there are security vulnerabilities, Microsoft still remains as a dominant enterprise because of its significant role in the cybersecurity industry and its revenues from the security business.

In my opinion, although this incident did not have a huge impact on Microsoft's important data and information, it should still be taken seriously by Microsoft's security department. They need to prepare for the potential escalation of cyber attacks, as they are responsible for the security of a large number of users. Although Microsoft's stock price has not been affected due to the government's continued reliance on its services. But as Senator Ron Wyden stated, it is "inexcusable" and "negligent." So while the article highlights the company's resilience and continued growth in the face of challenges such as security breaches, the security department still needs to strengthen its defenses to avoid a significant impact on Microsoft's overall business trajectory.

Overall, the two articles discuss the cyberattack on Microsoft from different perspectives, one arguing that the incident represents a larger national security concern and needs to be taken seriously by the company's security department, and one emphasizing the fact that Microsoft did not suffer any damage. I think this incident needs to be taken seriously and be prepared for more severe and advanced attacks.
